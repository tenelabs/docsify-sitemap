Create structured, SEO-friendly sitemaps for your Docsify projects in seconds.

## Note

- The repository must be public.
- This tool uses GitHub's free-tier API, which allows up to **60 requests per hour** per IP address.
- To increase the request limit (not unlimited, but significantly higher), you can use a personal access token (PAT).
- Paste your PAT key into the **Enter PAT field** to authenticate and increase your limit.
- Donâ€™t know how to generate a PAT? [Click here for instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
